Humanity is not about showing passion and empathy to each other at times of need but about
regarding love in high esteem and kindness in all walks of life. Humanity is not just a word
for symbolizing the human compassion and civilization but it goes beyond the horizons of human
nature and his creations. It is all about using hearts along with the minds in all the endeavours
of human kind.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Purification rites are required whenever there has been some kind of
polluting contact. In addition, cultures may institutionalize regular, periodic purification
rituals on the general principle that pollution occurs all the time. Important changes of status
or quests for special or sacred status may be viewed as progressions from lesser to greater states
of purity, and such changes or quests thus entail rites that promote the anticipated progressions.
Purification is invariably required before any contact with the sacred. Purification also is
generally considered necessary after any kind of traffic with the demonic forces and black magic,
because these contacts with the nether realm are viewed as polluting experiences. Purification
 rites also may be required before undertaking a major endeavour in order to ensure the
 participant’s success and a right relationship with the special powers involved in the project

matters with God/Higher Power, within oneself, and with other people.
These conflicts generate distressing emotions and questions about one's spiritual
journey in life.

<p>Major life stressors affect people not only psychologically, socially, and physically,
but spiritually as well.  Natural disasters, accidents, illnesses, and other
stressful events can threaten or harm people spiritually, triggering spiritual problems.

<p>Spiritual problems in coping represent efforts to protect or transform peoples’
relationships with whatever they hold sacred, including their connection to God/Higher Power,
their spiritual identity, and their connections to a religious community.

<p>What questions do you ask yourself every day?

Believe it or not, the questions you ask yourself affect the life you lead.
That’s because the questions you ask determine what you focus on, leading to
certain actions (or inactions), thereafter causing the results (or lack of) in your life.

When you ask limiting questions, you get limiting answers, often causing you to
circle in the same negative state in life. On the other hand, when you ask forwarding
questions, you get solutions, ideas, and new perspectives, which then help you break out
 of a negative state and rise to the next level.
